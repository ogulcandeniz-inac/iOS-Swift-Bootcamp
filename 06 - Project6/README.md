## About
The weather application I developed automatically displays the weather for the user's current location using iPhone's GPS data. Additionally, users can manually search for weather information by entering a city name. The app features a user-friendly interface with dark mode support and efficiently utilizes Swift's powerful features.

## Topics
* Dark mode support and utilization of vector assets has been completed.
* User input is received using UITextField.
* Swift protocols and delegate design pattern have been implemented.
* HTTP requests are made in APIs using URLSession.
* JSON is parsed using native JSONDecoder.
* GPS data is acquired using Core Location.
## Improvements
I developed an application that supports dark mode. This app adds visual appeal by using vector images as visual assets. I researched Swift's delegate model, protocols, and extensions to effectively use UITextField to get input from the user. The 'Guard' keyword and calculated properties allowed me to take advantage of Swift's powerful features. My skills in networking and sending HTTP requests with URLSession. I learned to parse JSON data with native Encodable and Decodable protocols. I used Grand Central Dispatch to manage the main thread. And finally, I learned to get the user's current location from the phone's GPS using Base Location.
