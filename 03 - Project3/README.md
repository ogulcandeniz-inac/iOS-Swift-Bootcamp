## Topics

* Swift Collection types - Dictionaries
* The Swift Timer API
* Conditional statements - IF/ELSE
* Conditional statements - Switch
* Functions with outputs
* How to use the ProgressView


## Improvements

- Conditional expressions in the if/else structure were converted into switch cases, increasing the readability of the code and ensuring modularity.

- Time-based calculations of the cooking time of eggs were carried out using the Timer API. Tools such as AVAudioPlayer are integrated to notify the user when the timer is completed.

- ProgressView was used to visually display the progress of tasks to the user.
